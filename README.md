# SFML-flappy-bird

Flappy Bird "clone" built for windows and linux using procedural programming and sfml libraries. Written using **C** programming language. Cpp extension was needed in order to utilise SFML libraries. Logic was done procedurally.

***MANUAL***

You can run executable file or compile directly with makefile. Note that you should link /include and /lib from SFML in order to compile and run.
Best to use with VS code (hidden .vscode folder containing a lot of pre-setup done, add include path).
